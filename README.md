# SkillsTV-application
This Project is actually a vision, a free live television application that kinda looks like Netflix but instead of have a repository of movies it will have a repository of live television channels.the project is still on going, front end was created with react javascript i have no idea what to use for the back end, i made use of firebase for login authentication, to enable users login to the homepage of the application, credentials can be found on file.  i am open to suggestions and collaboration to making this vision come to life.
